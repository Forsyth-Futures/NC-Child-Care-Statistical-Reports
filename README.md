# North Carolina Child Care Statistical Reports

The North Carolina Division of Child Development and Early Education's Statistical Detail Report is a 1000+ page monthly statement providing child care licensing data for each of the more than 9000 individual child care centers and family child care homes across NC. 

Child care programs are listed in this report by county, with family child care homes listed first in license number order, followed by child care centers. Summary information is given at the end of each county group, as well as statewide summary information at the end of the full report. Unfortunately, the data is imprisoned within PDF files.

The PDF files can be found here: (https://ncchildcare.ncdhhs.gov/County/Child-Care-Snapshot/Child-Care-Statistical-Report). This repository provides csv files of the data imprisoned within the PDF files. One difference in the csvs compared to the PDF files is that the Category Operation and Operation Site columns in the PDF files are merged in the same column within the csv file. The is a by-product of how the data is extracted, and a follow-up script will clean and separate these column so they mirror the PDF files.

To save a csv to your personal desktop, first click on the year and month csv file you desire. Next, click `View Raw` then right click on your mouse and click `Save as...`.
